## Company Background & Expertise

### Founding Story
Archpoint Labs, LLC was founded in September 2025 by Matt Stogner and Aidan Kane, two experienced developers who are excited to join forces after successful individual consulting work. Matt and Aidan first met through the UGA Mentorship Program where Matt served as Aidan's mentor during his junior year at UGA. They maintained their connection after the program ended, and Matt was consistently impressed with Aidan's innovative approach to hardware and software experimentation - from building smart assistants with Raspberry Pi connected to LLMs to creating Chrome plugins that summarize web pages.

The timing was perfect when Aidan graduated and began building websites just as Matt started his own consulting practice. While both were successful individually, they recognized that combining their expertise would allow them to tackle projects more efficiently and take on larger, more complex challenges.

They named the company Archpoint Labs as a subtle nod to their shared background at UGA.
